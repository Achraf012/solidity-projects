# npm resolution error report

While resolving: undefined@undefined
Found: chai@5.1.2
node_modules/chai
  dev chai@"^5.1.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer chai@"^4.2.0" from @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@2.0.8
node_modules/@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers
  peer @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@"^2.0.0" from @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@5.0.0
  node_modules/@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
    dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@"^5.0.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
