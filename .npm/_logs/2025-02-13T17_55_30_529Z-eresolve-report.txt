# npm resolution error report

While resolving: undefined@undefined
Found: @types/chai@5.0.1
node_modules/@types/chai
  dev @types/chai@"^5.0.1" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @types/chai@"^4.2.0" from @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@5.0.0
node_modules/@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
  dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@"^5.0.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
